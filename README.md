# won-transport

Code for applying the Web of Needs in the transport domain.

## Purpose

## Build instructions

Make sure you have the `webofneeds` artifacts in your local repository (by locally building the [Webofneeds](https://github.com/researchstudio-sat/webofneeds/) project) and then use maven to build this project:

```
mvn install
